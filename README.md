Summary:
The objective is to develop a software product for an actual client who intends to use it in regular production. Our group gained inspiration too...

A task management app that incorporates ChatGPT and other key features to simplify tasks for the user.

The core features of the app are:

1) Utilization of openai's chatgpt to help break down user tasks into smaller sub-tasks.

2) Time tracking on individual tasks

3) Speech to text

4) Calendar integration for daily scheduling

5) Auto scheduling

## Introduction

Welcome to the GPTask repository! This project is the culmination of our work in the Software Engineering Principles I course, where we developed a task management application to streamline task organization and simplify user workflows.

## Project Description 

The objective of GPTask is to develop a feature-rich task management app that incorporates ChatGPT and other key functionalities. Our app aims to enhance task organization and productivity for users by providing features such as task breakdown, time tracking, speech-to-text, and visual planning through a calendar interface.

## Repository & Installation Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

- Modify/Install Visual Studio 2022.
- During installation, select the ".NET Desktop Development" workload to add the required components for debugging WPF applications.
- Clone the repository and set the startup project to "gptask" if it is not set as the startup project by default.
